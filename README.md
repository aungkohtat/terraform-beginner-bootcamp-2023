# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023
## Project outline
**TerraTowns** serves as a centralized platform where terraformers can explore and link up with each other's self-hosted personal websites (TerraHouse), reminiscent of the Geocities style of 2023. The terraformers utilize Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to launch their **TerraHouse**, a Content Management System (CMS) that empowers them to create their own personal websites and integrate them into the TerraTowns network.
## Week 0 
Week 0 taught me effective documentation writing, VS Code shortcuts, and working with GitHub (PRs, Issues, Git CLI).
## Week 1 
In Week 1's live session, we hosted a static website using S3 and CDN. Comparing CloudFront to S3 for making a website publicly accessible, CloudFront adds extra security like a firewall, while S3 lacks security in this regard.
